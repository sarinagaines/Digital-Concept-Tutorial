#### What is Markdown?
According to Wikipedia, Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

## Headers

For H1, use one "#" in front of the header, so "#"
For H2, use two "#" in front of the header, so "##"
H3, "###"
H4, "####"
H5, "#####"
H6, "######"

Example: 
"# H1" will look like
 # H1
 "## H2" will look like
 ## H2
 "#### H3" will look like
 ### H3
 "#### H4" will look like
 #### H4
 "##### H5" will look like
 ##### H5
 "###### H6" will look like
 ###### H6

## Emphasis
Markdown allows one to create emphasis using italics, bold,a combination of both or strikethroughs. 

To italicize, put astericks or underscores at the begining and end of what you want to italicize. Do not put a space between the astericks/underscores and what you want to italicize. 

Example: " * This is italicized* " outputs: 
*This is italicized*
"_ This is italicized_" outputs: 
_This is italicized_"

To bold a word, use two astericks or two underscores at the beginning and end of what you want to bold. 

Example: 
"** This is bolded**" outputs: 
**This is bolded**
"__ This is bolded__" outputs: 
__This is bolded__

To bold and italicize word, use two astericks or two underscores at the beginning and end of what you want to italicize and bold. 

Example: 
"** This is bolded and _italicized_ * *" outputs: 
**This is bolded and _italicized_** 

To use strikethrough, use two tildes at the beginning and end of what yo uwant to strikethrough. 

Example: 
"~~ Strikethrouh ~~ " outputs: 
~~Strikethrough~~

## Links

To create a link, follow this syntax without any spaces: 
[ Title of link ] ( actual link )

example:
